Info


 The index.jsp file gets loaded when url is localhost:[port]/helloFromSpring/index.htm

 localhost:[port]/helloFromSpring/hello/sayhllo || localhost:[port]/helloFromSpring/hello/sayhello.htm 
 generates error
 
 
 Which means Controller is not configured well....
 
 please help me configuring the controller to be called from the browser
